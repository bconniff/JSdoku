JSDOKU - JAVASCRIPT SUDOKU SOLVER

JSdoku is a web program for solving Sudoku puzzles using Donald Knuth's Dancing
Links (DLX) implementation of Algorithm X. The program is written in a
combination of JavaScript, CSS, and XHTML, and licensed under the 3-clause BSD
license. You can find license details in the LICENSE file, located in the root
directory of the source distribution.

The program solves Sudoku grids by converting them into an instance of the
exact cover problem, solving the exact cover, and then converting the result
back into an instance of Sudoku.

The program will find a solution to a puzzle if at all possible, and will also
detect if a puzzle is unsolvable.

JSdoku is essentially a JavaScript port of a similar program I wrote called
Jadoku, written in Java. You can find Jadoku at:
